To cost effectively meet this challenge, innovative new statistical screening techniques improve test effectiveness by first identifying “suspect” parts, that are then more extensively tested, sometimes using tests that specifically target the suspected failure modes. Such adaptive tests exploit statistical correlations in process, performance and defect parameters. This tutorial presents a range of such test methodologies, and illustrates their effectiveness with results from recently published studies on production parts. Commercial tools from new companies in the "Adaptive Test" space are also discussed. </p>');

The tests have to be created so as not to exceed the power budget of the design, while, at the same time not imposing excessive costs for testing under these constraints. DFT techniques are also needed to detect manufacturing defects on the low power structures introduced in the design. It is imperative for the DFT engineers to plan for these challenges starting from design architecture and implementation stage till the generation of manufacturing test patterns and application on silicon. In this tutorial, we will cover the challenges posed for DFT in low power designs and present the analysis techniques and design solutions available to address these challenges. In addition, we will also cover the EDA solutions available, both from test hardware and pattern generation methodology to handle the requirements of low power designs. The DFT practitioner will get an in-depth overview of the requirements of low power designs and the solutions available to deal with them. </p>');

Test and product engineers are confronted with designing complex test flows while meeting the test quality challenges still keeping the test cost low. Given the economics and market conditions and the complexity of testing pRoCs. Test and Product engineers are required to adopt novel methods to meet the product schedule and cost goals. The traditional approach of using compartmentalized test methods of sequentially applying digital test, followed by analog test and RF test will not be acceptable test for Internet of Things (IoT) and 5thGeneration application scenarios. In order to design, develop and execute the multi-dimensional test procedures, a Test Engineer will have to master test engineering for all the key components of IOT systems including but not limited to High Speed Interfaces and Security protocols, RF subsystem etc.,. The flow will have the comprehended need for ATE debug interfaces and hooks for collecting data for yield engineering while keeping the manufacturing throughput at optimal levels. <br>This Tutorial will help participants get an overview & Evolution of IoT, Low energy consuming architectures, various Test flows for Structural, Functional, HSIO (High Speed Input Output) and RF core testing of IoT. The Tutorial will then address the challenges of HSIO and RF test that have a significant role in test and validation of IoT pRoCs.  The HSIO test will address different types of HSIO test approaches using both Hardware and Software techniques like RAT, Smart loop back, Hard & Soft Synchronization, Internal and External loop back methods. In RF, will discuss how the IoT pRoCs specification fits in the existing ATE instrument available today.</p>');

To accomplish this goal, diagnosis is performed on thousands of failing chips in volume mode along with layout awareness to allow modeling of complex faults and to determine the physical shapes impacted by the defect. Subsequently, diagnosis results from various failing dies are post processed and analyzed to identify systematic defects. New challenges are introduced in diagnosis methodology due to shrinking geometries resulting in defect types such as bridges, opens, cell-internal defects, test data explosion resulting in advanced compression and low pin Test Access Mechanism (TAM) architectures such as 2-D Elastic Compression, LBIST, SmartScan, etc., design size explosion resulting in multiple defects and tester constraints restricting the amount of failure data collected for a failing die. These challenges not only impact the accuracy and precision of scan and logic diagnosis but also the amount of throughput obtained in a volume diagnosis environment. <br>This tutorial explains the basic concepts of scan and logic diagnosis in a traditional full scan test mode with standard stuck-at fault model. Subsequently, this tutorial describes the challenges and considerations for setting up a layout-aware volume diagnosis methodology and some possible solutions to enhance the QoR and performance of the system.</p>');

Apart from functionality, it also provides distinct challenges to a test engineer. Security chips are threatened by powerful attack vectors, called Side Channel Analysis which exploits the physical manifestations like power, faults, etc. to reveal secret keys. Likewise, security chips which are designed in off-shore fabs are suspected for surreptitious modifications which are extremely hard-to-detect, called Hardware Trojans. This motivates for the development of new test methodologies for evaluating countermeasures against side channel analysis, and also construct new ATPG methods for identifying Trojans. However, though necessary, Design-for-testability (DFT) can also open back-doors for attackers, exploiting the same controllabity and observability offered by these DFT artifacts. The Tutorial provides an end-end perspective on these topics, by presenting some classic attacks on crypto-chips targeting scan chains. It then suggests some secured-chan mechanisms. Subsequently, it presents a background on side channel analysis, and surveys a popular leakage assessment methodology. In the final part of the talk, we discuss about an ATPG methodology for detecting malicious modifications to circuits using Genetic Algorithms and Boolean Satisfiability. Throughout the talk, we try to mention metrics for the various assessments, and hope they can be used to develop suitable objective functions in future computer-aided-test tools for cryptographic circuits.</p>');
